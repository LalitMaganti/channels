Channels
======

Channels is a new next-generation IRC client for Android. Written in Kotlin and designed from scratch for Material Design in mind, it aims to become the most functional yet elegant IRC client on Android.

Building
------
Channels is easy to build with Gradle. It requires the use of Relay, the IRC library powering Channels. The following commands allow building of Channels:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tilal6991/relay-jvm.git
./gradlew assembleDebug 
```

Current status
------
Currently Channels is in a pre-alpha state with much work being actively carried out to get it to a releasable state.

Roadmap
------
* Get things to a functional state
* Alpha Release
* Beta Release
* Final Release(!)
